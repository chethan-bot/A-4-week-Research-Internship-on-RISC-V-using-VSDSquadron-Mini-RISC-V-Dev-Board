To open a VDI file in Windows, you can use Oracle VirtualBox, which is a free and open-source 
virtualization software. Here are the steps to open a VDI file in Windows using VirtualBox:

1. Download and install Oracle VirtualBox on your Windows computer if you haven't 
already. You can download it from the official website:

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Launch VirtualBox and click on the "New" button to create a new virtual machine. Fill 
up the details as shown in the image below.

4. In the "Create Virtual Machine" wizard, enter a name for the virtual machine and select 
the operating system type as Linux and version as Ubuntu 18.04 that matches the one 
installed in the VDI file you want to open!

6. On the next screen, allocate memory

7. Create a virtual hard disk. Choose the "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" option and 
click on the folder icon to browse to the location of the VDI file on your Windows 
computer

8. Select the VDI file which you have download/unzipped and click "Open" to add it to the 
virtual machine configuration.

9. Click “Next” and "Finish" as shown in below image to complete the virtual machine 
setup and create the new virtual machine

10. Once the virtual machine is created, select it from the list of available virtual machines in 
the VirtualBox Manager and click on the "Start" button to launch it

11. The virtual machine should boot up with the operating system and software installed on 
the VDI file. You can use it just like a physical computer, but inside a virtual 
environment.

That's it! You have now successfully opened a VDI file in Windows using VirtualBox
