4. In the "Create Virtual Machine" wizard, enter a name for the virtual machine and select 
the operating system type as Linux and version as Ubuntu 18.04 that matches the one 
installed in the VDI file you want to open

5. On the next screen, allocate memory

6. Create a virtual hard disk. Choose the "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" option and 
click on the folder icon to browse to the location of the VDI file on your Windows 
computer

7. Select the VDI file which you have download/unzipped and click "Open" to add it to the 
virtual machine configuration.

8. Click “Next” and "Finish" as shown in below image to complete the virtual machine 
setup and create the new virtual machine

9. Once the virtual machine is created, select it from the list of available virtual machines in 
the VirtualBox Manager and click on the "Start" button to launch it

10. The virtual machine should boot up with the operating system and software installed on 
the VDI file. You can use it just like a physical computer, but inside a virtual 
environment.

That's it! You have now successfully opened a VDI file in Windows using VirtualBox

and your password will be "vsdiat"
